# A-1 Create New Files

A Phaser game runs in a web browser. Your Phaser game will consist of an HTML file named`index.html`, a CSS file named `style.css`, and a JavaScript file named `script.js`.

In addition, your game will need to load the Phaser game framework, which is a JavaScript file named `phaser.min.js`. You'll also want to create a folder named `assets` that will contain all the asset files \(images, sounds, etc.\) for your game.
