# D. Side-Scrolling Game

TK - in progress

Create a more complex game \(side-scrolling platformer\)

Your game world and your game canvas can be the same size â€” or they can be different sizes. By default, they are set to the same size. The size of the game canvas represents what is displayed to the player at any given time. However, you can make your game world larger than your game canvas \(and then make the game canvas scroll automatically as the player's character moves through the game world\).
