# TEMP - Links to Old References

{% hint style="danger" %}
**UPDATE IN PROGRESS:** This new code guidebook will have revised versions of the Phaser references in the previous guidebook. In the meantime, you can still access the previous Phaser references for creating games:

* [introducing you to Phaser](https://docs.idew.org/video-game/project-references/phaser-introduction) \(what is it, where to download, etc.\)
* [creating a Phaser game template](https://docs.idew.org/video-game/project-references/phaser-game-template) \(HTML, CSS, and JS files with starter code\)
* [finding and creating visual assets](https://docs.idew.org/video-game/project-references/visual-assets) \(animated sprites, etc.\)
* [finding and creating audio assets](https://docs.idew.org/video-game/project-references/audio-assets) \(sound effects, etc.\)
* [coding common game features using Phaser CE](https://docs.idew.org/video-game/project-references/phaser-coding) \(adding objects, detecting collisions, etc.\)
{% endhint %}
